<!--Hello, maker! Welcome to my Electrate Fuego web design tutorial. I'm glad you found it – for this might be a real intersection on your way to becoming. I (S.J. Quigley) use this document in my Technical Communications classes at the University of Pittsburgh to teach my students a little bit about computer science and something called "electracy." Just follow along with comments like this one, and you'll make a really cool web documemt that not only introduces you to the other people in our classes, but will help you process how different discourse communities in your life have contributed to your arrival in this space, virtual and actual, and also contribute to where you might be going.

In this doc, you will work through Gregory Ulmer's discourses of career, family, entertainment, community, and schooling (_Internet Invention From Literacy to Electracy_, 2002.) In Ulmer's text, he elides community and schooling into one category, but for our puposes I have separated them. Ulmer's theory of electracy helps makes sense of how we find/construct meaning and connect with others rhetorically in a media rich ecology. Ulmer uses analogy to define electracy, explaining that "electracy is to digital media what literacy is to print."

You could make this document the easy way--like I once did by using a program called Adobe Spark: https://spark.adobe.com/page/umUY5ROHgANCl/, or you can do a little more work to unconceal, opening up these tools that you use every day, but might not know how they function, yet prove so necessary to how you (re)present yourself and connect with others in virtual spaces. And this last bit is an important point! If we really want to be makers, if we really want to be creative, then we need to understand what our digital tools do, how they work, and consider the implications of their use. Through this process you will also learn a little bit about computer literacy and computer science. Enough to allow you to build web texts and understand file management.

So let's cut this thing open – using "tmesis" as the Ancient Greeks would call it – lets "cut" and arrange, tweak, take away and augment...that's how we create! I hope you're excited to use this tool to create a document that will simultaneously help you process your journey and help orient you along the path on which you are headed in your becoming. Before we get going I would like to give a shout-out to my research buddy Shauna Chung, who helped me develop the original Ulmerian framework we will be following in this document. Are you ready to get started?-->

 <!--To get started, you will need to fork my repository from GitHub if you haven't already. If you want to easily publish it on GitHub, I'll give you more information at the end of this document. But for right now, fork, and then download the website to a zip file (or clone it, if you know what that means). Go ahead and put these files in a secure place (folder) where you will be able to find them and organize your other assests like images, pdfs, etcetera. You will also need a text editor like "brackets.io" or "atom.io" or "notepad-plus-plus.org." Open the style.css and index.html documents in the text editor and we can get started building our own electrate experience.-->

<!--BTW. You can leave these hidden HTML text fields be, or delete them. They are but road signs, absent from the larger design-->

<!--First we will need to do some work in the head of the document. The head organizes important information needed to expalin to browsers how the website will work. Go ahead and change the title of this HTML document below, from "Electrate Fuego" to whatever you want it to be called. Your new text will appear in your browser tab-->

<title>A little bit about me, Sam Taylor</title>

    <!--this next section of code does important work to help different browsers understand what this page should look like on the different kinds of screens.-->

<!--The body of the document houses the content that a user usually sees on a website. We'll be spending most of our time in this section.-->

<body>

<!-- We'll need to do some more work in this section, but to do so, we'll need to make some changes on your style.css file. Developers refer to this division as a "Hero Block," but we will refer to it as a "Wide Image."  Think carefully about the image you select and how it might serve a sybolic function in your life. Ulmer refers to these kinds of symbolic images as "wide images" in that they often repeat over and over in our lifetime. We will similarly repeat this image at the end of your Electrate Infuego composition to establish a motif in this web document.

Place a .jpg or .png in the same file folder as this project (hint: simplify the name). You don't need to do anything on this html page, but you'll need to change the background image name on the style.css page to match you image asset.

Now, change the other relevant information in this section, especially if you're not John en Fuego or not majoring in "electracy"-->

      <!--In our first exploration of discourse, we're going to think about the wider characteristics or themes of our field or future career. In academia, we do a lot of work narrowing our interest to arrive at a career or profession, often reducing our field to a level of operation or an act. Instead, I would like you to think more broadly about the "wider themes" you associate with your field or future career and its larger significance in improving our world. Yes--improving the world. Thinking back, where do you see exposure to those same "wider themes" in your own life? Those ah-ha moments, lessons, examples, tools, passions, or qualities that suggested this career path to you? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that begins with "Lorem ipsum."-->

     <div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>Field or Career</h1>

  <h2>
      Engineering, to me, represents a certain type of problem solving: solving problems by enabling and engaging a change of perspective. Some engineering problems are absurd and complex, but can be abstracted and simplified over and over again until suddenly there's a solution. I think twisty puzzles are lovely examples of engineering principles. The puzzle shown is a Pentultimate Puzzle designed by Jason Smith. Twisty puzzles are especially devious because they're visually simple, and often playfully colored. But for someone to be able to solve a twisty puzzle, they usually have to break out a pencil and paper, document observations, and act methodically. Engineering can change lives for individual people, and sometimes engineering solutions can be introduced to large groups at the same time, but I truly believe that engineering's impact is not inherently global. I have the privilege of using the Internet, which is an incredible invention built on the back of uncountable hours of engineering work. But a large portion of the global population still doesn't have Internet, so has the Internet changed the world? Not the whole world, no. The Internet pushed some groups into new eras of invention, but also left many behind. It's complicated. Many major innovations follow this same pattern of only being available to a subset of people, even if that process leaves everyone else behind. However, I know that my career path has made me a better person. I can look at problems from a clear, focused perspective, and methodically figure out where I am and where I'm trying to go -- in engineering/academic contexts or otherwise. This problem solving process liberated me from many unfocused and unorganized tendencies I'd had for my whole life until college. I look forward to using these problem solving skills in a way that is genuinely constructive for more people than just myself.

<!--in this next section you will explain a little more about your family (what does family means to you? Who are the people that influenced you on this path along which you now stand).-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h1>
      My nuclear family and the people who influenced me are not the same. But my nuclear family, extended family, and friends all encouraged me to pursue engineering -- in fact, I don't think anyone seemed surprised by my decision, nor disapproving of my decision. But my nuclear family is probably the most dependable among these people, at least for support. My mother is probably the most generally supportive person I know, and my personality is just like my father's. My only sibling, my twin sister, is definitely the most reliable person that I know who's my age, and we both progress further by depending on each other.

<!--We will begin this section with a photo grid. Add those beautiful, meaningful "family" and "home" photos (only you can define family) to your project folder, making sure the files end in .jpg or .png and replace/add the names of your assets to the grid below. You can add more photos if you wish, or subtract... see what happens – you have to be playful to find the purpose of things. You may need to adjust the size of your assets to produce the effect you desire. Resizing local files is one way to control the size of images on a website.-->

<!--Time to write. Flesh it out! Define family, qualify it, explicate it telling us why these people are important, and how they contributed to how you got here and where you are going. What about "home." What  does that mean to you? In what ways is it significant in determining where your are going? Replace the content between <h2> and </h2> that says "Lorem ipsum."-->

<div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>
      The above images depict, in a broad sense, my family and home. Admittedly, I felt pressured to use less-conventional definitions of "family" and "home." Regardless, if I truly believed my family were limited to my blood relatives and that a home were limited to a house, then I would've expressed that here. The following text feels honest even on a visceral level, but it's treacly. Maybe a month ago, I was unexpectedly reminded of my own mortality. I funneled my resulting anxiety into a thought experiment: Assuming I'm as able-bodied and able-minded as I currently am, what would my ideal "last day on Earth" (or last living day) look like? I envisioned myself and a large group of people on a long porch/deck/balcony, eating barbeque and generally enjoying each others' company. The emotional connection between everyone was so overwhelmingly loving. While most folks at this imaginary barbeque of mine weren't related to me by blood, I'd consider anyone with whom I share a mutual love connection -- in the broadest sense, definitely including non-romantic love -- to be my family. The balcony shown above is my neighbor's, and plenty of real-world factors would prevent me from bringing my whole family onto that balcony. I included that picture specifically because the colors of the balcony, chairs, and tree leaves are bright and charming.
      Some of the most important members of my family are those in my nuclear family: my mother, my father, and my twin sister. We're all cordial amongst each other, and we support each other through everything. If I'm concerned about my amibitions or about the future, my parents are extremely understanding and open-minded. If my sister or I are struggling with the present, we can talk to each other about anything, and I'm confident we could overcome virtually anything.
      Where my nuclear family helps me achieve the things I want to achieve, many other members of my family help me identify what I want to achieve in the first place. My freshman year roommate in particular broadened my worldview immensely, but many of my other friends also engage in activism etc. You may notice a lack of house pictures, considering I mentioned in the caption that I'd included pictures of home. I used to associate houses and homes similarly, until a brief, shocking period when I lived in sketchy off-campus housing. During that period, I listened to lots of songs about house-versus-home. The house/home songs which most resonated with me were "House Where Nobody Lives" by Tom Waits and "Homebody" by Nai Palm. The former describes home as the love inside a house, and the latter describes home as a feeling in someone's own body. My synthesis of these ideas, plus my own experiences, is that a home is an environment of comfort. Just as a house protects its inhabitants from physical storms, home protects its inhabitant from emotional storms. As I progress into a career and develop myself as an adult, my family and my home are my foundation. No matter where I go, I can find new family and can I bring home with me. Neither my home, my family, nor myself determine my exact path or destination. But my home and family enable my exploration.

<!--Now we are moving into the kinds of media that contributes to your everyday discourse. This might sound weird, but Ulmer argues that media has actually contributed a great deal to who you are as a person, how you language yourself, and even how you move through the world and interact with others. So, let's take some time to explore this discourse area. You have the opportunity to add video content or other significant media content. You might also add images to this section (see the bottom of this sheet for directions on how to add elements) perhaps adding a photo grid like the one you did for the "Family" section. Experiment.

  <h2>
      I use media for information and entertainment, which takes up a substantial portion of my life. Often my peers and I consume media together - we predominantly communicate in online groupchats nowadays. I honestly don't have a solid idea of the different types of media. I trust newspaper and printed sources a whole lot more than what I see on the Internet, but I use the Internet for almost all of my entertainment, and also to defer me to printed sources. I also stream music a ton, which doesn't affect me in the same way that news media might, but it guides many of my aesthetic decisions. Media is so ubiquitous. Media serves social function because it's almost impossible to separate any facet of life from media. What else would we talk about? I have no vision of recreating or remaking media in my everday life. I merely anticipate navigating media. Even if I make a piece of media, where does it fall in the sea of media? It doesn't even make a ripple, surely. Nor do I reinvent media. I'm pretty sure I consume media as the media-makers intend.

    <!--So what exactly is your community: is it actual? virtual? Where do find your ground, or at least, where do you drop anchor, you drifter, you? While we often think of communities as neighborhoods and clubs and a group of colleagues or friends, you might find community across the frontiers of the dead, and perhaps even with those who have never lived. I'll let you explain. -->

    <div class="par-centertext">
  <h2>
      My community is strictly virtual nowadays. Most of my friends are on a single Discord server, and we all chat with each other. Some of my friends, a subset of this Discord server, are in a coronavirus-safe pod. This pod meets in person every weekend to do homework, and we also hang out every so often. In general, I trust in my ability to befriend people. Community is usually fluid, albeit extremely slow. But coronavirus makes it harder to meet new people, and meeting new people is the incentive for community to "flow," so this community that I'm currently a part of feels, for all intents and purposes, permanent.

      My education at Pitt helped me develop a problem-solving character. I don't know if I could have realized or summoned that ability within myself were it not for college. I anticipate getting textbooks and unofficially learning all the things I want to know. I also intend to go to graduate school at some point, even though not directly after my undergraduate education. I'd like to work for a little while and gain some more focus in what I want to do. I think I want to do controls systems, but I'm currently enrolled in the controls course and I'd like to test the waters first. I did get a taste of controls at robotics co-op, and that was immensely exciting. But higher education is so expensive, it's hard to make a single commitment.

      Even now as someone who's almost graduated college, I still feel a little wronged by the American educational system. I think it's wrong to assume an eighteen-year-old would know what to do with their life, or understand the implications of higher education. I still don't have a 100% idea of what I want my career to be.
